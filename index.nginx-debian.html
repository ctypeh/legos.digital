<h1>Hi! Welcome to Cox's Blocks, a Minecraft: Java Edition server.</h1>
<!--<h4>Do By Friday is a weekly challenge show hosted by Merlin Mann and Alex Cox. <a href="http://dobyfriday.com">You can listen to it here.</a> </h4>-->
<!--<h4>This server is run by <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexCox">Alex</a> for the Do By Friday community.</h4>-->
<!--<h4>This server is lovingly run by claire. You can reach her at the Discord link below.</h4>-->

<h2>Joining the community</h2>

<p>You can join the server by typing "<b>coxblocks.rocks</b>" in the Multiplayer menu of your <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition">Minecraft: Java Edition</a> client. You can use the "Direct Connect" option, but we recommend using "Add Server" to permanently add the server to your server bookmarks list. The server is running Java 1.16.3.</p>

<!--<p>This server also runs <a href="https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser">Geyser</a>, a proxy that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients to join. However, your experience connecting with a Bedrock client may be buggy. If possible, we recommend playing using Java Edition.</p>-->

<p>You can chat with other members of this community on our Discord server. <a href="https://discord.gg/apR8puc">Click here for a Discord invite.</a></p>

<h2>Rules and expectations</h2>

<p>We have a few rules we'd like you to follow on the server:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No griefing. This means destruction of other players' property, general harassment, harm, or other actions that cause grief - thus the term griefing. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
	<li>Be friendly. We'll all have a better time if we get along and work together.</li>
	<li>No hacking, malicious mods, exploitation, duping, or other unfairly advantageous manipulation of gameplay. Cheaters never prosper.</li>
	<li>Please respect the landscape! Clean up after yourself, respect the natural beauty of the world, and cover up any messes you make.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Map</h2>
